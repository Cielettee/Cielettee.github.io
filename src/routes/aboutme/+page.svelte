         I'm a cyber security analyst, electronics systems engineer, programmer, occasional artist, and mouse lover!</p>
      <p class="pt-5 font-mono text-[#F2613F] text-lg">
         I was born in Rio de Janeiro and moved to the United States at a young age. I was always a little nerd, playing video games, which inspired me to try making them myself. I created simple game projects, learning programming along the way, and advanced to using Unity for more complex projects. I learned to create my own artwork to bring my game ideas to life, which developed into a keen interest in art, particularly pixel art.</p>
      <p class="pt-5 font-mono text-[#F2613F] text-lg"> 
         I earned my degree in electronic systems engineering, where I gained extensive knowledge in coding and explored hardware and circuits. In college, I worked at a security operations center initially for convenience. However, this experience sparked a passion for cybersecurity and networking, shaping my career path ever since.</p>
      <p class="pt-5 font-mono text-[#F2613F] text-lg"> 
         I currently work full-time as a Tier 1 security analyst at a Managed Security Service Provider (MSSP) security operations center. I continually strive for new challenges and growth opportunities. I actively work on certifications and engage in red team training to pinpoint my ideal niche within the cybersecurity field. At this time, I am focusing on the Game of Active Directory and PortSwigger labs.</p>
