      I'm a cyber security analyst, electronics systems engineer, programmer, occasional artist, and mouse lover!</p>
   <p class="pt-5 font-mono text-[#F2613F] text-lg">
      I was born in Rio de Janeiro, though I don’t mention it often, and moved to the United States at a young age. Was always a lil' nerd, playing video games since I was young which eventually led me to attempt to make them myself.  I started by creating simple game projects, learning basic coding along the way, and eventually progressed to using Unity for more complex projects. To bring my game ideas to life, I had to create my own artwork, which led me to develop a keen interest in art, particularly pixel art.</p>
   <p class="pt-5 font-mono text-[#F2613F] text-lg"> 
      I eventually pursued a degree in electronic systems engineering, where I gained extensive knowledge in coding while also exploring hardware and circuits. During my college years, I began working at a security operations center, initially for convenience. However, this experience sparked a passion for cybersecurity and networking that has shaped my career path ever since.</p>
      <p class="pt-5 font-mono text-[#F2613F] text-lg"> 
         I am currently employed full-time as a Tier 1 security analyst at a Managed Security Service Provider (MSSP) security operations center. Despite this, I am continually striving for new challenges and growth opportunities. I am actively working on certifications and engaging in red team training to pinpoint my ideal niche within the cybersecurity field. Currently, I am focused on the Game of Active Directory and PortSwigger labs.</p>
